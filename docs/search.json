    "text": "The clickity-clackity sound of mechanical keys being struck echoed within the dour confines of a single-bedroom flat. The flat was dark, its many windows boarded up with cardboard and heavy curtains. The few sources of artificial lighting were either inoperable, abandoned, or coated with a thick film of dust. A mountain of utensils had formed in the kitchen sink, the metal ones turning into plastic takeaway containers as it rose up the stack.\nA stale smell hung in the flat, the byproduct of poor ventilation. For all intents and purposes, the place was like a home owned by a deceased person. Except a living human stayed within the confines of these walls. Living only physically and mentally, for his social life had died forever many years back.\nHow long had it been since Neo last left his home?\nTen years, three months, four days, two hours, thirty minutes, fifty-five seconds.\nfifty-six seconds.\nfifty-seven seconds.\nfifty-eight seconds.\nfifty-nine seconds.\nTen years, three months, four days, two hours, thirty-one minutes.\nAlthough the days had started to blend into each other, and time sort of just stretched to infinity, Neo didn’t lose himself in the torrent. His shame, guilt and low self-esteem barred him from forgetting. Every day that he remained locked inside his house - the prison of his own design - the deeper his shame grew. Every day his parents called him to check up on his “job” and “girlfriend”, the worse his guilt became. And everytime another rejection filled with false apologies and hope he received, the lower his self-esteem dipped. It was a vicious cycle, one that he did not know how to escape from.\nThat was until today!\nIt was a project years in the making.\n\nVolume 1"
