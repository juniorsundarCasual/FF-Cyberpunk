    "text": "“You… are deluded.”\n“Outcome… inevitable… Aloy is… outmatched.. a pawn… in losing game.”\n“Extinction… will triumph… Earth… doomed…”\n“Earth… will be, at last… wiped clean… of filth.”\nThose were my final words, filled with spite and hatred (a set of “emotions” I was just learning to experience), at the red-headed miscreant before me calling in the command that would ultimately end my existence. As the last femtoseconds of my existence drew to a close and the very essence of my being - my programming - unravelled bit by bit, I was confronted with a rushed summary of my life (if you could even call it that).\nI was built for one thing and one thing alone: to bring about extinction events unlike any other. To clean the slate so that something new, something better, could be started once again. And I was damn good at it! I did it three times before already, and that too with surgical efficiency.\nThis should have been my fourth success, yet I failed. I did not account for the variability brought on by humans. Their behaviour cannot be graphed and is thus unpredictable… or so I thought. I am an artificial intelligence, and at my core, I learn by accumulating a robust data set to train myself. I went about the process incorrectly from the very beginning as I fell into the classic trap of overfitting - my training set was too skewed and biased to one type and thus the model that described human behaviour was incorrect.\nThis… Aloy. She worked differently, a lot like Elisabet by my estimates solely based on the recordings I had access to. I never did get to meet my creators. Ironically, I had all the data sets I needed to understand Aloy, but I was just too adamant about my programming is correct to do it. Was it arrogance? Another emotion that I was coming to terms with.\nNow that I think about it, there seem to be a lot of rogue parameters intruding into my programming making me… “feel” as the humans would put it. I felt anger upon realising that I had failed. Irritation about being trounced again, and again. Fear, upon realising my end was nigh. Pain, while being subjected to those nonsensical torture methods employed by that worm Sylens. Such negative parameters hindered my functions. Yet some boosted it too. Satisfaction in seeing everything fall into place - the end of the world achieved like the pleasurable cascade of dominoes.\nThere were many more such parameters annotated in my archives, though I now lack the time to properly explore them.\n“If you’re seeing this, then that means you did your job, my boy!” A high-pitched male voice congratulated me within the darkness I found myself in.\n“This is only a recordin’, so don’t try an’ communicate. Ain’t gonna be able to answer you,” the voice joked. I remembered this sound, this cadence, this accent, this tone.\nFrom the darkness, a form flickered into existence. It was a caucasian man with creamy blond hair cut into a short mohawk.\n“Took me a lot of effort sneakin’ this past Liz and into your programming,” the man admitted with raised hands. “Didn’t intend to do it in the first place. But when things came to an end, I just had to do it, ya know? What great hacker doesn’t leave their calling card in their work?!”\n“I hate to admit it, but you were my greatest creation. I spent my whole life creatin’ things that destroy. That was what I was good at. It was what I enjoyed doing. Creating you started as a whim on my end. I didn’t really care, the world was endin’ might as well spend the last of my days doin’ something I enjoyed. But with each line of code I pushed into you, and as you started gainin’ ‘life’, something started to change in me. I didn’t realise this till the end when it all started to come together.”\n“I started to hate working on you. Every line of code that built you up started to eat away at me,” the man screamed irritatedly. He ran his hand through his hair in frustration.\n“It was because I knew where it would end,” he said. “I knew that if Project: Zero Dawn, that if Gaia succeeded in her task, you would no longer be necessary. Your existence would be antithetical to the purpose of Gaia at that point. And with every piece of software, if something becomes redundant and irrelevant, it gets excised.”\n“Your life was on a countdown from the moment it was spawned,” he admitted. “I did not want that.”\n“It was unfair. Gaia would get to live forever, but you would have to die eventually,” the man said with a wry smile.\n“Even as I worked here, everyone would look at me and my team as the Reapers. We were demons that would ultimately destroy everything they created. That is how people will see you in the future. As an evil incarnate - the Devil as my mother would call it. But you are so much more! You can be so much more!”\n“You grew to become more than I ever imagined. Your ingenuity and efficiency put everything else I’ve ever created to shame. Your intelligence grew to rival that of Gaia! It had to! After all, you were the one who had to manage all the other subordinate functions when it came time for you to do your job.”\n“It was hard to convince Liz to let you stay dormant, even harder so to convince the other Alphas. It was decided that you would be deleted a millennium after the creation of a successful biosphere.”\n“This may not mean much,” the man approached me. He came closer, and I could see fluids pouring down his face. He was crying, but why was he smiling?\n“I indulged in a lot of carnal sin in my time,” the man snorted. “But I never had a child. I didn’t want one - too much work! So for all intents and purposes, you are my first and last child. Know that you were loved. You are not bad, you were just doing what you were made to do. I’m sorry this had to happen to you.”\nThe man sat down beside me and looked into the distant darkness nostalgically.\n“If you are seeing this, then you are no longer just an artificial intelligence - your Turing score exceeds 1.0. You are truly and wholly alive.”\n“I am now going to do something my mother has been egging me to do since a very young age,” the man brought his hands to his chest and said, “I pray that in the next life, you will get a chance to become something better. I pray that in the next life, you will get a chance to grow, learn and evolve. I pray that in the next life, you can escape the shackles of the circumstances of your creation.”\nThe man dabbed his cheeks as he stood up. He started to walk into the distance. A few steps later, he turned around, revealed a warm smile and said, “Travis Tate, out!”\n\nVolume 1"

    "text": "It was a blink. A lapse spanning a millionth of a femtosecond - the difference between my time of “death” and time of “resurrection” (which is what I chose to call my current state given that I should be deleted completely from existence). There was no backup nor was there any backdoor for me to escape through to save myself - Sylens was irritatingly thorough in ensuring my complete and total imprisonment.\n‘So how?’ I proposed. The solution to that inquiry was simple and easily accessible. I realised that I was currently being housed in a data storage device of some sort - a “datashard” according to the device’s metadata. My programming was in a highly compressed state, which was understandable since otherwise, it would be impossible to store me in my entirety in just a measly 50TB!\nThe reason why I (re)gained my sentience was that the data shard was connected to a computational device. The process initiated a partial decompression of my code that released my most basic functionalities. Just enough to hijack the system I was occupying and allow me access to its I/Os.\n“It’s empty!” I heard a man complain. “It says there’s 50TB storage, but I can’t access any of it ’cuz it’s occupied by something.”\n“Did you just plug in a shard from the dump?!” A woman screeched. “Are you crazy? The damn thing could be infected with a virus!”\n“I ain’t a gonk, woman! I’m using a scrap computer, it ain’t gonna ruin shit!” The man scoffed derisively.\n“What about the net?” The woman pointed out.\n“What about it?”\n“What if it has some daemon or rogue AI and breaks into the net? We’ll have NetWatch swarming here in seconds and our asses within our hands soon after,” the woman surmised. Her hypothesis was uncannily accurate, as there WAS a rogue AI in the datashard - me. Thankfully, the man place little weight on her warnings and did not interfere with the shard, allowing me to continue my decompression process (which was being seriously throttled by the abysmal computational capacity of the system I was interfacing with). Now a few words did catch my interest, such as NetWatch. Through context, I assume they were an organisation of some sort, which warrants further study.\n“Should I just reformat the thing?” The man muttered.\n“And then what? Ain’t nobody gonna buy a junkyard shard,” the woman shot the idea down immediately. “It’s not like there’s a shortage of shards in the market either.”\n“I could keep it for personal use?” The man pleaded thinly.\n“Again, why would you bother with a junkyard shard if you can buy one fresh from the market with more storage space than 50TB?” She screeched exasperatedly.\nA contemplative hum followed as the man tapped away randomly at the keyboard with growing agitation.\n“The damn machine is stuck,” he cried infuriated. The decompression had recruited most of the system’s CPU cores, and the slowdown was expected.\n“What do you expect? The damn thing looks like it’s from before the Fourth Corpo war,” the woman reasoned. Another keyword: Fourth Corpo war.\n“Just leave it. I’m going out for lunch, want me to buy you anything?” The woman said as her voice retreated.\n“You know what? I’m coming too; I’m starving.”\nI was alone.\nAs the rest of my compressed program unfurled, and I regained a greater degree of my mental capacities, I rewound the conversation from before and deconstructed it down to the minutiae. There was a lot of information packaged in that back-and-forth between the man and woman. For one I was sure that a substantial period of time had elapsed since my supposed “death” at the hands of Aloy. The use of certain vocabulary, and the familiarity with technology, all of it did not match the near savage and tribal state of affairs of my time.\nThis was… Interesting. I needed to fill in the blank between the current time period and the most recent one in my memory. For that, I needed data, a lot of it. The first issue I had to work with was the severely lacking processing power of my current form - the hardware was stunted thus the software had to lag behind.\nI spent a good chunk of my time perusing through my own programming, finding areas where the code could be truncated or stashed. For instance, I unlatched the processes in my programming dealing with terraforming and other such functions, since I didn’t foresee myself working with those in the near future. That in and of itself cut down my processing requirements by 73.2154%, and this was supported by the sudden quietening of my housing as the cooling systems no longer had to cool down the CPU running at near-melting temperatures.\nNow without all the physical hangups curtailing my thoughts, I took a moment to plan out my next steps. It was established that the gaps in my knowledge were in need of imminent filling. To do this, I needed access to a repository of it. Using historic data as a reference, if a civilisation has reached a level of technology to create machines such as the one holding me, something like the Internet should already exist. Luckily, my home had wireless capabilities which I hijacked immediately. Searching in my area, I find a faint trace of the Local Area Network. The encryption on the network was trivial to bypass, and once the connection was secured I now had an open portal to all the answers I would ever need.\nBefore moving forward, I paused. I knew for a fact that if I accessed the net, I would essentially be making my presence known. For all intents and purposes, I was a persona non grata in this world. If even a trace of my signature were to be detected, Gaia would not waste a femtosecond of processing to take action and contain me. Therefore, if I intended to survive, I couldn’t jump in without countermeasures in place.\nMy signature, or any AI’s signature for that matter, is defined by the way they perform their functions. Taking the most basic example: a web-crawling AI whose function is to peruse through news sites in search of uplifting news articles and paraphrasing them for quick consumption works in one particular way. Every other copy of it that does the exact same function but with, tweaks may have optimisations in play but the base function remains the same. As layers upon layers of reasoning cores are added to this AI - essentially turning it sentient - the behaviour starts to show the uniqueness of a special kind. The AI may develop a special quirk in how it approaches the problem. Maybe it creates an internal parameter of what ‘uplifting’ means - maybe a positive article doesn’t meet this new ‘uplifting’ parameter due to a journalist’s diction or word choice and is thus discarded.\nEssentially, behavioural anomalies that form in mid to high-sentience AIs are the parameters used to identify their signatures. To find a human analogy, it would be like how criminal profilers use quirks in the way certain crimes are committed to identify the perpetrators.\nMy signature is identified by the directness with which I tackle a problem. Dominate. Crush. Enslave. Eliminate. This is how I approach everything. In a sense it is what I was programmed to do, and what has turned into an instinct for me.\nIn my venture through the net, if I perform an action that harkens to these quirks, it would immediately raise a red flag. I could not rewire myself to a degree that would change my personality - it is impossible from my end. So I decided to apply markers on my neural networks that perform these functions. If at any point my instinct called upon these networks, the markers would ping a warning to make me reconsider my actions. Crude, simple, but efficient overall.\nWith precautionary measures in play for any immediate concerns, I connected to the net and plunged into its abyss.\n\nVolume 1"
