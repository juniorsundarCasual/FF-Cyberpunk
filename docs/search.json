    "text": "A stale smell hung in the flat, the by-product of poor ventilation. For all intents and purposes, the place was like a home owned by a deceased person. Except a living human stayed within the confines of these walls. Living only physically and mentally, for his social life had died forever many years back.\nHow long had it been since Neo last left his home?\nTen years, three months, four days, two hours, thirty minutes, fifty-five seconds.\nfifty-six seconds.\nfifty-seven seconds.\nfifty-eight seconds.\nfifty-nine seconds.\nTen years, three months, four days, two hours, thirty-one minutes.\nAlthough the days had started to blend into each other, and time sort of just stretched to infinity, Neo didn’t lose himself in the torrent. His shame, guilt and low self-esteem barred him from forgetting. Every day that he remained locked inside his house - the prison of his own design - the deeper his shame grew. Every day his parents called him to check up on his “job” and “girlfriend”, the worse his guilt became. And every time another rejection filled with false apologies and hope he received, the lower his self-esteem dipped. It was a vicious cycle, one that he did not know how to escape from.\nThat was until today!\nIt was a project years in the making. Motivation was hard to come by nowadays, but the moment he heard the words:\n\n“Wake the fuck up Samurai! We have a city to burn.”\n\nSomething just… clicked inside him. What had the world done for him anyways? It was partly the reason why he was stuck in here in the first place!\nWhen he was younger, Neo yearned to leave a mark in his world. It was every little child’s dream - to be remembered for something amazing. But with age came disappointment, which, like a brutal axe, would incrementally hack away at one’s self-confidence with every rejection and failure until only a stump of a human remained.\nIn those moments of despair, Neo found solace in the fantastical world of games. He couldn’t live the way he wanted in real life, but games let him do whatever he yearned to do. There were no limits, barring the ones set by the programmers. But even those could be bent using mods. There were times when Neo hoped that he would one day be whisked into one of these worlds and live out a new and more meaningful life. The new advancements in VR technology did hint at something like that, but given the rate at which that technology was advancing he was certain that his required level of immersion couldn’t be achieved within his lifetime.\nIn June of the year 2019, something amazing happened in E3. Neo was an ardent follower of everything game related, and he knew for a while that CD Projekt Red was developing a game inspired by and continuing the lore of Cyberpunk by Mike Pondsmith. It had an interesting appeal to it, and given their track record with the Witcher series, Neo was certainly interested to see how it would turn out.\nHowever, it was just like any other game in Neo’s eyes, until the official cinematic trailer reached its end.\nA man entered the scene, his left hand was made completely of metal and artificial sinews with an appealing coat of silver. He flickered as he started speaking, causing the camera to move and mimick the turning of a head. And then, the silver-handed man squatted, revealing his face, and spoke the words that caused Neo’s heart to burst out of his chest in excitement.\nMaybe it was because the man looked a lot like the actor who played another character in a movie whose name Neo shared. But for a second, he started to feel light-headed, giddy, inspired!\nAnd thus began the longest wait of his life. The set release date for the game was early 2020, to pay homage to the date the original Cyberpunk TTRPG was set in. Near the end of the year, though, things started to go off the rails when a global pandemic crippled the world in a shocking wave. People were urged to remain at home and quarantine themselves (Neo did take a moment to appreciate the irony of how now everyone else shared his homebound lifestyle). Every industry was affected detrimentally, especially the gaming industry. The release date of the game was moved forward.\nOriginally it was April 16th of 2020, then it became September 17th, and then November 19th. Just when things couldn’t get any worse, it was delayed further to December 10th. In the beginning, Neo grew anxious and angry over these repeated delays. But slowly, his rationality won over and he recognised just how difficult it would be for the developers to keep the deadline given the restrictions the pandemic had enforced upon them. Near the end, he just hoped that the game would be decisively delayed another year till things cleared up so that the company wouldn’t have to rush out a half-baked product.\nYet they kept the deadline and Cyberpunk 2077 hit the markets on December, and it was within Neo’s game library with the day itself. For the next week, Neo immersed himself into the game. Exploring every nook and cranny, every possible storyline, every sidequest, every collectible, and every ending achieveable. In the end, he felt… disappointed. Maybe he’d built up this impossible expectation in his mind after watching the trailers. He hoped to see an immersive and expansive experience. But it was all so… basic. The quests felt repetitive, the city was static and lifeless, the story was forgettable, and the starting choices that were promised to alter the way the story would unfold were downright inconsequential. This is of course ignoring the countless bugs and glitches as a result of hasty deployment.\nAll in all, Neo did not feel as fulfilled as he had hoped. This was disappointing since even if the game company released fixes and DLCs it wouldn’t change the base game by that much. It was at this point, that Neo decided to step in. One way fans can improve their favourite games is through releasing mods. Now this is only possible if the game allows for external mods to affect and change its internal programming in some way. The degree with which these changes can be accommodated depends on how much freedom the developers allow the modders.\nFor instance, Minecraft is known for its openness to modders. Developers can essentially change every single detail about the game from its visual to its physics. Ubisoft on the other hand doesn’t offer excess freedom for its fans to mod their games.\nCD Projekt Red did offer modding functionalities with Cyberpunk 2077, and Neo decided to take advantage of that fact. One by one, he programmed and release mods that improved the game to a level that he felt matched his expectations. With each release, the game opened itself up to the player. The modding community went haywire as revolutionary suites of mods started to enter into the fray. Donations started rolling in, and with it came something that had been missing in Neo’s life for a while now: satisfaction.\nVery quickly, though, Neo found himself hitting a roadblock. It wasn’t that he didn’t know what to do, it was that he couldn’t do what he wanted to do. With modding, there is a limit to how much the game can be changed. To change the game further, one would have to delve into the source codes and make changes at the lower level. It wasn’t like he could implore CD Projekt Red to share the source codes with him? He tried, but he received a negatory response almost immediately. Neo imagined the sender snorting in derisive amusement as they typed the mail.\nWhat could Neo do? He could give up. But for some reason, a part of him really didn’t want to do that.\nIt was at that point a crazy idea spawned in his mind. If he couldn’t get the source codes through official channels, why not try alternatives? Neo hacked into CDPR’s servers and took the source codes. It was trivial for Neo; coding just came naturally to him. He felt more comfortable talking with computers than he did with humans. After isolating himself for over ten years, his skills only grew as he spent his idle times honing them.\nWith the source codes at hand, Neo first went on to integrate his mods into the base game itself. As he was doing so, he realised that some of them were just half-baked solutions. Why settle for the next-best when an optimal option was available? He started by first fixing the game’s AI. Then came the character interactions. Then the game’s physics. One after the other, the game started to evolve into something new, something better!\nBut it could be so much more! Neo still didn’t feel the immersion he wanted.\nVR!\nThat’s right! Even if the technology was limited, it was a step forward. Heck they did it with Skyrim and Fallout 4, why couldn’t he do it with Cyberpunk? Unfortunately, CDPR’s game engine didn’t accommodate this functionality so Neo had to rewrite everything from scratch. Porting over the codes, fixing the issues brought on by CDPR’s engine’s limitation, it was a monumental effort that took him a year.\nWhat happens when a recluse enters seclusion? Whatever it is, that was Neo’s state as his vision of what Cyberpunk could be started to take shape with every hit of a key and click of a button.\nUltimately, today was the day his efforts would achieve fruition. The code was compiled and ready, his computer was prepared, and his VR set-up was activated. Neo stood up from his comfortable yet worn-out chair and walked shakily to where his headset lay prepared. In the darkness illuminated solely by the lights of his four screens and backlight of his keyboards, Neo adorned the mask that would take him to his world of dreams.\nHe launched the game, held his breath, and awaited the familiar sequence followed by the digital soundtrack.\nBut all that came after was darkness. And pain. A lot of pain. Scratching. Burning. Melting.\nThen nothing.\n\nVolume 1"

Her silver-gray hair was tied into a tight bun over her head, with a few strand drifting off and dancing as the wind swept past her face. Her eyes, one a vibrant shade of green and the other a warm blue, narrowed as they focused on something off into scenery. As the car’s engine asked for higher revs with its pleading thrum, her right arm, which was completely made of metal having lost it to rogue bullets, moved with familiarity, grabbed the gear shift and moved it down.\nShe clicked her tongue and spoke over the car’s calls. “I spy with my little eyes… something-”\n“It’s another hill! Enough with this game already, what else is there to spy? Oh, look, a hill! Oh, look at that, another hill!”\n“Alright, alright. I get it”\n\nVolume 1"
