A loud rumble followed as a vehicle burst over a sandy hill, releasing a trail of dust in its wake. The vehicle was a Thorton Galena GA40xt, with a rusty shade of brown and an even lighter brown. Its chassis and body were reinforced to withstand the unkempt and rowdy terrain of the lands between civilisation (though some would argue if "civilisation" was the right word to call those concrete jungles at the brink of degeneracy). At the car's either side, spread over its two doors, was a prominent yet fading design of a demonic head flying with a wings of a bat - the Bakkers mark.

Through the lowered window on the driver's side, a girl rested her elbows on the window frame as she directed her gaze to the vast emptiness outside. Her silver-gray hair was tied into a tight bun over her head, with a few strand drifting off and dancing as the wind swept past her face. Her eyes, one a vibrant shade of green and the other a warm blue, narrowed as they focused on something off into scenery. As the car's engine asked for higher revs with its pleading thrum, her right arm, which was completely made of metal having lost it to rogue bullets, moved with familiarity, grabbed the gear shift and moved it down. 

She clicked her tongue and spoke over the car's calls. "I spy with my little eyes... something-"

At that moment, another annoyed voice interjected her from the passenger's seat, "It's another hill! Enough with this game already, what else is there to spy? Oh, look, a hill! Oh, look at that, another hill!"

"Alright, alright. I get it "
