The clickity-clackity sound of mechanical keys being struck echoed within the dour confines of a single-bedroom flat. The flat was dark, its many windows boarded up with cardboard and heavy curtains. The few sources of artificial lighting were either inoperable, abandoned, or coated with a thick film of dust.
